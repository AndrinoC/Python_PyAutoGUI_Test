How it works:
- A window will open requesting your friend's username and a text to be sent
- After pressing "Send" the script will scan for the provided images at "resources\image_detection"
- Mouse will be moved until the "search friend" tab is focused
- When in "search friend" tab the script will write your target and hit enter
- Upon reaching the target's chat the script will paste your text and send it
